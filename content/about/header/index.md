  Hi there! Welcome.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
  It’s easy to be seduced the hottest trends in data science: AI, machine learning, bigger and bigger data. These tools have their place, but many organizations face a much more mundane problem: They have a bunch of data that they don’t know what to do with. For example:
  
* A medical practice that has thousands of patient surveys that they want to analyze but aren’t sure where to start. 
* A non-profit that wants to create a data visualization for a grant proposal, but all of their data is stuck in 10-years of Excel files.  
* A growing small business that has been manually creating sales reports every week but wants to start automating them.  
My goal is to help you and your organization with these types of problems. Rather than having to purchase expensive software or hire a full-time person, my mission to provide you what you need in a short amount of time and at an affordable rate. So, whether you are a small non-profit, a large for-profit business, or something in between, please get in [contact](mailto:spirgel@gmail.com) if you are interested in chatting!
