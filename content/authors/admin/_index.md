My background is in cognitive psychology, and for my [dissertation research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10648-014-9290-2), I examined how writing helps (or doesn't help) people learn new information. I have worked in  education since 2011, and I am [certified by RStudio](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/) to teach the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). I am available to train groups or individuals to learn R and the tidyverse, and to consult with organizations to help them meet their data analytic needs.
