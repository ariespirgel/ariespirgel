I work with organizations to help them get the most out their data. Whether its cleaning messy data, creating compelling visualizations, automating reports, conducting exploratory analysis, or some other data analytic problem, my goal is to help improve the quality and efficiency of your work. 

  The hottest trends in data science (e.g., AI, machine learning) have their place, but for many organizations they are beyond what is needed for the issue they face: A bunch of data that they don’t know what to do with. For example:
  
* A medical practice that has collected thousands of patient surveys that they want to analyze but aren’t sure where to start 
* A non-profit that wants to create a data visualization for a grant proposal, but all of their data is stuck in 10 years of messy Excel files  
* A growing small business that has been manually creating sales reports every week but wants to start automating them  

I am interested in helping you and your organization with these types of problems, without you having to purchase expensive software or hire a full-time person. So, whether your analytics needs are for a small non-profit, a large for-profit business, or something in between, please get in [contact](mailto:spirgel@gmail.com) to learn more or to set up a time to talk about a project you have in mind.
